Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. 

Class is a blueprint which defines some properties and behaviors. An object is an instance of a class which has those properties and behaviours attached. A class is not allocated memory when it is defined. An object is allocated memory when it is created. Class is a logical entity whereas objects are physical entities.
